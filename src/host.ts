/**
 * pi-delegate — src/host.ts (WorkerHost seam, extracted from src/transport.ts).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — the backend-neutral worker-host seam: Transport interface
 * + req/result types, the E_* error taxonomy (incl. DelegateErrorImpl/GUIDANCE),
 * the report/mailbox envelope contracts and their guards, the worker-name rule,
 * briefPrompt, the budget/context gauge constants, sessionHasReply (the
 * aged-finish session-JSONL proof — backend-neutral: it reads the worker's
 * pi session JSONL, never the host backend), and the worker console event
 * envelope (ConsoleEvent/ConsoleEventKind) with the OPTIONAL streamConsole
 * seam method (full-fidelity live console streaming; implementations without
 * an event store omit it and callers degrade to readConsole polling).
 *
 * Dependencies: node builtins (fs, path) + pi's getAgentDir()/CONFIG_DIR_NAME
 * from @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent (the platform package — Law 1: import,
 * never reimplement). Depends on NO other src/ module — bottom of the import
 * graph (the old src/transport.ts SECTION 1 + the backend-neutral
 * sessionHasReply/Errors blocks, byte-verbatim).
 *
 * The herdr IMPLEMENTATION lives in src/herdr/host.ts (SECTION 2 verbatim);
 * it is bound ONCE in index.ts (workerhost migration steps 5–6 — the old
 * src/transport.ts re-export shim is deleted). Tool modules (spawn/observe/
 * fleet) import the seam from ./host.ts and must NEVER import
 * ./herdr/host.ts directly (pinned by static-check T1.1/T1.1c /
 * watcher-check W1.1).
 *
 * I/O: the seam performs no I/O of its own, with ONE documented exception —
 * sessionHasReply() reads the caller-supplied session JSONL with readFileSync
 * (the aged-finish proof; backend-neutral by construction since the path is
 * an argument, see its FUNCTION_CONTRACT below). This is the audit's
 * acknowledged deviation, stated here per Law 2.

/**
 * pi-delegate — transport seam and shared contracts.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP: this file is authored by the tech lead and is the review artifact
 * for the whole extension. Implementation workers must NOT edit it; they code
 * against it. If a contract here is wrong, escalate to the orchestrator —
 * do not patch around it locally.
 *
 * Dependency rule: spawn.ts (tools) and index.ts (commands, absorbed in W5)
 * may import transport.ts and exchange.ts only. They must NEVER import the
 * herdr IMPLEMENTATION directly — createHerdrTransport is bound once in
 * index.ts (pinned by static-check T1.1/T1.1b).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT (ZCS, ported from the bundle's types.ts header): pure
 * types, constants and tiny pure helpers — no I/O of its own. Critical
 * invariants: DelegateErrorCode is the FIXED E_* list (the transport maps
 * every herdr failure into exactly one of them — never raw throws past the
 * tool boundary); WorkerReport is the schema BOTH the delegate tool
 * (validateReport) and the watcher validate reports against — changing it
 * breaks both sides at once; Transport implementations must serialize
 * mutating ops internally (ARCHITECTURE.md Law 4); REPORT_EXAMPLE is the canonical
 * report shape embedded into every worker prompt; CONTEXT_WINDOWS mirrors
 * pi's model catalog values and must be kept in sync with it manually.

 *                               was likely never consumed (D3);

 *                               late (herdr ages done→idle within minutes and
 *                               current builds never report working for pi

The orchestrator exports SWARM_TASK / SWARM_WORKER / SWARM_SCHEMA_DIR into your environment when the backend supports it; rely on that when present, and pass the explicit --brief/--task/--worker flags shown in every example below so the invocation works regardless. Verbs: \`read-brief\` (bun ${SWARM_CLI_PATH} read-brief --brief ${briefPath} ${identityFlags}) reads your brief; \`ask\` (bun ${SWARM_CLI_PATH} ask --question "<text>" ${identityFlags}) posts a question — then go idle and use \`poll-answer\` (bun ${SWARM_CLI_PATH} poll-answer ${identityFlags}) to fetch the answer, polling again between steps when the brief says steering is expected; \`write-progress\` (bun ${SWARM_CLI_PATH} write-progress --phase "<label>" [--pct <0-100>] ${identityFlags}) records a liveness ping; and \`write-report\` (bun ${SWARM_CLI_PATH} write-report --brief ${briefPath} ${identityFlags}, report JSON on stdin) writes your final report. Never hand-write report, mailbox, or progress files — the verbs own those paths and formats.${fallbackText} When the task is complete, write your report with \`write-report\` and reply with only the file path. Report contract — this contract ALWAYS overrides the brief on report format/shape: if the brief's OUTPUT section specifies a different report shape, keep ALL required contract fields anyway and put the brief-specific data in extra fields. Required fields: "worker" must be exactly "${workerName}"; "status" strictly "pass" or "fail" (never "done"/"ok"/"success" — a report with any other status is rejected at collect and wakes your orchestrator); "summary" a non-empty string; "artifacts" an array of strings; "evidence" an array of objects, each with non-empty string "claim" and "file". Extra fields allowed. Canonical example (write the report as JSON in exactly this shape): ${JSON.stringify({ ...REPORT_EXAMPLE, worker: workerName })}.${schemaEcho}`;
