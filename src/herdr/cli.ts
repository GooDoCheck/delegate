/**
 * pi-delegate — src/herdr/cli.ts (the herdr CLI subprocess runner).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — one responsibility: launch one `herdr <args>` subprocess
 * with a hard time bound, preserve the historical exec error shape, and parse
 * herdr's stdout result line. Extracted verbatim from src/herdr/host.ts
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md Law 5 decomposition); the FUNCTION_CONTRACTs and
 * BUG_FIX_CONTEXTs below are its contract and travel with the code.
 *
 * Dependencies: node:child_process ONLY — no seam import, no other src/
 * module. This layer speaks EXEC-SHAPED errors (killed/signal/code/stdout/
 * stderr); mapping them into the E_* taxonomy is the caller's job
 * (HerdrTransport), which is what keeps the CLI runner reusable and the seam
 * bottom-of-graph (pinned by test/herdr-split-check.ts).
 *
 * Windows launch policy (TZ §3.6): on win32 the herdr CLI is typically an npm
 * shim (`herdr.cmd`), which modern Node refuses to spawn shell-less
 * (CVE-2024-27980 → EINVAL) and a bare spawn does not resolve at all (ENOENT).
 * The win32 launch goes through `cmd.exe /d /s /c` with per-argument quoting
 * in one tested helper (winQuoteArg); the argv stays an array end-to-end —
 * never a pre-joined shell string. The platform is injectable (optional
 * trailing `platform` parameter, module-level default DEFAULT_PLATFORM) so
 * tests on a POSIX host drive the win32 branch without a real Windows machine
 * (ARCHITECTURE.md Law 1: the platform is the API). The POSIX default path is
 * byte-identical to the pre-1.17 spawn shape. Windows kill escalation uses
 * `taskkill /pid <pid> /T /F` (tree kill — herdr's own child processes die
 * too) instead of child.kill("SIGKILL"), which on Windows kills only the
 * direct child and leaves agent orphans. These herdr CLI/OS details never leak
 * above the adapter (src/herdr/).
 *
 * Critical invariants carried over verbatim: the always-settling call (timeout
 * SIGTERM + stdio destruction + SIGKILL escalation after SIGKILL_GRACE_MS),
 * exec-parity failure shape (callers' message regexes unchanged), the
 * tolerant last-JSON-line stdout parse.
 *
 * DOCUMENTED DEVIATION (ARCHITECTURE.md Law 8): runHerdr is the single place
 * in this extension where a raw `throw new Error` is allowed — the parity
 * wrapper that keeps the historical exec error text for the callers' matchers.
 * It never crosses the seam: HerdrTransport wraps every CLI failure into a
 * structured E_* DelegateError.

/**
 * Run one `herdr <args>` CLI call with a hard time bound and SIGKILL escalation.
 * <p>
 * FUNCTION_CONTRACT:
 * Input:
 *   - args: herdr CLI argv (array — never shell strings)
 *   - timeoutMs: hard bound on the call (default CLI_TIMEOUT_MS = 30_000)
 * Output: { stdout, stderr } of a zero-exit run
 * Guarantees:
 *   - the promise ALWAYS settles: at timeoutMs the child gets SIGTERM (execFile
 *     parity), its stdio is destroyed (parity with node's exec timeout), and
 *     after a further SIGKILL_GRACE_MS it gets SIGKILL — so a herdr build with
 *     a graceful-shutdown SIGTERM handler cannot hang this promise forever
 *     (BUG_FIX_CONTEXT below). The promise rejects AT timeoutMs, not when the
 *     escalated kill lands.
 *   - failure shape preserved from the promisified-execFile implementation:
 *     the thrown error carries .killed/.signal/.code/.stdout/.stderr and its
 *     message carries stderr text — callers match error text (isNotFound,
 *     agent_name_taken, agent_prompt_stalled regexes) against it unchanged
 *   - the child is reaped even when it dies AFTER the rejection (external or
 *     escalated SIGKILL): the parent's loop reaps it via the still-open libuv
 *     process handle — no zombie while the loop is healthy
 * Raises:
 *   - Error (wrapped by callers) for non-zero exit, spawn failure (ENOENT),
 *     maxBuffer overrun, or timeout
 * EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY: `herdr` CLI binary on PATH (resolved at spawn time).
 *   On the injected win32 policy additionally: cmd.exe (the Windows command
 *   interpreter — the launch shim for npm .cmd shims) and, on kill escalation,
 *   taskkill.exe (the Windows tree-kill) via the same policy.
 * <p>
 * BUG_FIX_CONTEXT (SIGKILL escalation, 2026-09-09 herdr incident follow-up):
 * symptom — the promisified execFile timeout sends SIGTERM only; a herdr build
 * with a graceful-shutdown SIGTERM handler survives it forever, the promise
 * NEVER settles (leak-probe sig.log; re-reproduced with a silent-trap stub:
 * pending past the 30s timeout mark), and via the serialized-mutations queue
 * in HerdrTransport every later mutating op (place/start/prompt/teardown)
 * stalls behind it while read-only ops and the event loop stay healthy
 * (h3-queue-stall repro). Why SIGTERM-only did not work: node's exec timeout
 * cannot recover a child that ignores SIGTERM, and D-state children would
 * ignore it too. What was done: kept the SIGTERM-at-timeout contract, then
 * escalated to SIGKILL after SIGKILL_GRACE_MS (armed at spawn, cleared on
 * close); the promise rejects at the timeout mark. Side-effect fix: the old
 * implementation RESOLVED ok-with-empty-stdout when the direct child had
 * already exited but a descendant kept the stdio pipes open (the timeout
 * "kill" hit a dead pid and node's close-on-timeout surfaced as success) —
 * the spawn-based escalation destroys stdio at timeout and rejects properly.
 * Exported for tests (transport-sigkill.ts drives it with stub CLIs).
 * <p>
 * FUNCTION_CONTRACT (Windows policy, TZ §3.6):
 * Input:
 *   - platform: optional trailing NodeJS.Platform (default DEFAULT_PLATFORM —
 *     the process's own platform). "win32" switches BOTH the launch and the
 *     kill escalation to the Windows shape; tests on a POSIX host inject it
 *     to drive the win32 branch without a real Windows machine.
 * Guarantees (win32 branch):
 *   - launch: cmd.exe /d /s /c <quoted herdr argv> — an npm .cmd shim is
 *     reachable where a shell-less spawn would fail EINVAL (CVE-2024-27980)
 *     or ENOENT; stdio/windowsHide identical to the POSIX branch
 *   - kill escalation: taskkill /pid <childPid> /T /F (tree kill — herdr's
 *     agent children die with the CLI process) instead of child.kill("SIGKILL"),
 *     which on Windows terminates only the direct child
 *   - the timeout rejection shape (killed:true, signal SIGTERM) is IDENTICAL
 *     to POSIX — callers' E_* mapping and message regexes are platform-blind
