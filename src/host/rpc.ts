/**
 * pi-delegate — src/host/rpc.ts (the `pi --mode rpc` backend adapter, PoC).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — a WorkerHost adapter that runs workers as headless
 * `pi --mode rpc` child processes of the orchestrator, removing the herdr
 * dependency entirely. Implements the Transport seam from src/host.ts:
 *
 *   place()       — worktree: plain `git worktree add` under
 *                   getAgentDir()/worktrees/<repo>-wt-<n>; shared placement
 *                   (wire mode "tab"): the caller's checkout, no isolation.
 *   startAgent()  — spawns `pi --mode rpc --provider P --model M --thinking T
 *                   --name <worker>` with cwd = the placement's checkoutPath
 *                   and, when the caller passes StartReq.env (issue #25:
 *                   SWARM_TASK / SWARM_WORKER / SWARM_SCHEMA_DIR), that env
 *                   merged over the orchestrator's;
 *                   captures the worker's session JSONL path via get_state
 *                   (StartResult.sessionPath — the budget gauges' input).
 *   submitPrompt()— writes {"type":"prompt"} over stdin; when the agent is
 *                   mid-stream, retries with streamingBehavior:"steer"
 *                   (mirrors herdr's prompt-into-console semantics).
 *   waitSettle()  — EVENT-DRIVEN, zero subprocesses: the `agent_settled`
 *                   stdout event is the settle proof. Strictly stronger than
 *                   herdr's status polling — pi's rpc protocol reports
 *                   "fully settled (no retry/compaction/queued continuation
 *                   remains)" directly, so the herdr-era §19.1b/§19.1c sensor
 *                   gaps (herdr builds never report "working" for pi workers;
 *                   done ages into idle) cannot occur on this backend. Full
 *                   seam contract honored: onPoll heartbeat,
 *                   abort-detaches-never-kills, proofSettled,
 *                   releaseOnStarted, settled-epoch keying.
 *   getStatus()   — mapped from tracked events: agent active (agent_start
 *                   seen, not yet settled) → "working", extension-UI dialog
 *                   pending → "blocked", settled → "idle", child exited →
 *                   "done", nothing observed yet → "unknown".
 *   readConsole()    — assembled from captured rpc output: assistant text +
 *                   recent tool calls + UI requests (bounded tail). Serves
 *                   the probe verdict ("OUTPUT: OK" readback).
 *   streamConsole() — OPTIONAL seam method, IMPLEMENTED here (the herdr
 *                   adapter does not have it — callers probe with
 *                   `typeof …streamConsole === "function"` and degrade to
 *                   readConsole polling). The stdout pump (single writer)
 *                   mirrors every parsed rpc record into the per-host
 *                   FidelityStore (src/stream-seam/) as one ConsoleEvent —
 *                   full-fidelity drop-oldest ring capped at STREAM_RING_CAP
 *                   events per worker; historical replay via afterSeq, a
 *                   truncated backlog opens with a gap marker, the
 *                   readConsole last-maxChars snapshot stays the fallback
 *                   beyond the retained window. The iteration stays open
 *                   while the worker lives (a settled worker may still be
 *                   prompted) and ENDS once the child process exits and the
 *                   backlog has drained — the exit handler closes the store
 *                   subscriptions. Zero new data sources.
 *   answerDialog()  — dialog-relay mode ONLY: answers a relayed extension-UI
 *                   dialog via the existing extension_ui_response stdin path
 *                   (adapter-level method — not on the Transport seam).
 *   teardown()    — abort over the child's stdin, then SIGKILL after a grace
 *                   period if the child has not exited on its own; `git
 *                   worktree remove` for worktree placements; idempotent
 *                   (alreadyGone); releases the worker's console ring.
 *
 * RPC protocol notes (verified empirically against pi 0.85.1):
 *   - JSONL framing: records split on LF only, optional trailing CR stripped
 *     (pi docs/rpc.md — generic line readers are non-compliant).
 *   - Responses correlate to commands via the optional `id` field.
 *   - extension_ui_request DIALOGS (select/confirm/input/editor) BLOCK the
 *     agent until a matching extension_ui_response arrives. DEFAULT (the
 *     `dialogRelay` option absent/false): this adapter auto-cancels them
 *     (worker sees undefined/false, same as an Esc) so a headless worker can
 *     never deadlock on a prompt no human will answer. With
 *     `dialogRelay: true` the dialog offer is relayed onto the console
 *     stream (kind "dialog") and stays pending — the consumer answers via
 *     answerDialog(); the auto-cancel write is skipped entirely.
 *   - extension_ui_request fire-and-forget methods (notify/setWidget/…) are
 *     ignored (they are advisory UI state); with dialogRelay on they are
 *     additionally mirrored onto the stream (kind "ui").
 *
 * KNOWN GAP (documented, deliberate PoC scope): rpc workers are children of
 * the orchestrator's pi process. After the orchestrator process exits, the
 * children keep RUNNING (they finish their task and write reports/mailbox
 * files to disk — file-based signals still work), but their stdin is
 * unreachable, so a LATER session cannot nudge them (mailbox answers degrade
 * to guidance-only delivery, exactly the existing nudge-failed path). Reattach
 * via a named-pipe shim is future work, not this adapter.
 *
 * Platform: both launch and kill go through the OS launch policy
 * (src/spawn-policy.ts), so the adapter runs on Windows too: a bare `pi` does
 * not resolve there (npm ships `pi.cmd`), and child.kill("SIGKILL") behind the
 * launch wrapper terminates the WRAPPER and orphans pi — on win32 the kill is
 * the policy's TREE kill instead. POSIX is byte-identical to the
 * pre-1.18 shape (a bare `pi`, the signal escalation untouched); the policy
 * target is injectable (constructor `platform`) so both branches are pinned on
 * any host.
 *
 * Dependencies: node builtins + getAgentDir() from the platform package
 * (Law 1 — no hardcoded .pi/agent joins). Imports the seam (../host.ts), the
 * leaf path/policy modules (../expaths.ts, ../spawn-policy.ts) and NOTHING
 * else from src/ — the adapter must never import tool modules.
