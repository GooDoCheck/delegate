/**
 * pi-delegate — src/swarm/snapshot.ts — the `swarm snapshot` orchestrator-side
 * read verb (issue #30, ARCHITECTURE §4.1.1/Law 13: the read-model's client
 * surface).
 *
 * MODULE_CONTRACT — the whole-graph half of the read API: serialize the
 * SwarmGraph (./graph.ts buildSwarmGraph — the canonical read-model) to
 * stdout with the real dependencies injected: the journal reader
 * (./journal-read.ts) and the ManifestStore of the CONFIGURED storage mode
 * (§4.1.3). PURE READ, ZERO WRITES: no journal event is appended, no
 * manifest.json projection is written, and no database is created or
 * migrated — in journal mode the manifest scan goes through the READ-ONLY
 * journal replay (scanManifestsViaJournalReader), never the store
 * constructor (whose writer open creates/migrates events.db).
 *
 * Stdout payload — the success envelope (./result.ts) carrying the frozen v1
 * snapshot contract: { ok, verb: "snapshot", snapshot: SwarmGraph }, where
 * snapshot is the graph's own Law 7 wire form (schemaVersion stamped inside
 * it by ./graph.ts — SWARM_GRAPH_SCHEMA_VERSION; the nested bytes are exactly
 * serializeSwarmGraph's output).
 *
 * Identity: NONE required — an orchestrator-side read, no SWARM_TASK/
 * SWARM_WORKER gate (§4.1.1; the #30 issue's decision). Stray positionals
 * still fail E_SWARM_USAGE (./cli.ts dispatch).
 *
 * Live status / usage are structurally unavailable to the CLI (a separate
 * bun process has no Transport handle, and the usage resolver is
 * extension-side): the graph marks those sources false and degrades the
 * affected nodes with flags (no-live-status / usage-unavailable) — degraded
 * fields, never a failure (Law 13; the same surface test/swarm-graph-check
 * G5/G8 pins at the projector level).
 *
 * Dependencies: ../profile.ts (loadDelegateConfig — the ONE config read),
 * ../manifest-store.ts (createFileManifestStore — the files-mode production
 * store), ./journal-manifest-store.ts (scanManifestsViaJournalReader),
 * ./journal-read.ts, ./graph.ts, ./storage.ts, ./result.ts. No herdr import
 * (Law 4); no sqlite driver import (the journal family owns that seam); no
 * write path anywhere under the verb. The storage-mode wiring
 * (`activeBackendName`, `manifestSource`) is EXPORTED — ./verify.ts reuses
 * it so the files/journal mode choice has ONE writer.
 *
 * Critical invariants:
 *   - never fails on data: buildSwarmGraph never throws, so any degraded
 *     source yields a valid (possibly empty) graph with available:true, or
 *     the fully-degraded fallback graph (available:false) — exit 0 either way
 *     unless the failure is a usage failure (Law 8);
 *   - exactly one JSON object on stdout;
 *   - the reader is closed on every path (finally);
 *   - the manifest scan backend name mirrors index.ts's resolveConfiguredHost
 *     tolerant leg (missing/corrupt config → "herdr"); an UNKNOWN host value
 *     degrades to "herdr" instead of throwing E_START — this is a read
 *     surface, not a session-start gate (Law 8: a read verb never crashes).
