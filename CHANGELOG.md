# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Version numbers are the semver `X.Y.Z` in `package.json` (runtime source: `src/version.ts`, byte-matched by a static pin); git tags mirror them as `vX.Y.Z`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Aggregation chain check: `swarm verify [--task <id>]`.** The third
  orchestrator-side read verb machine-checks the orchestration convention
  that fleet numbers travel verbatim up the chain: for every task manifest
  it reads each worker's report and emits pass/fail lines for `presence`,
  `schema` (the ONE base validator), `chain` (every parent fact
  `k="<child>_number"` equals the child's fact `k="number"`) and `arithmetic`
  (a parent fact `k="partial_sum"` — and a `partial_sum=<S>` summary token,
  when present — equals the child-number sum). Pure read over the snapshot
  verb's storage-mode wiring (exported so the files/journal mode choice has
  ONE writer); degraded data yields degraded verdicts, never a crash (Law 8);
  the envelope's `verify.ok` carries the chain verdict. Pinned by
  `test/swarm-verify-check.ts`.
- **Static pins for the new seams (#31, swarm-core-v1, Law 6).** Three
  shape pins in `test/static-check.ts` make §4.1.2/§4.1.3 fail CI, not
  reviews: **sqlite confinement** (T1.12 — no src/ module outside the
  `src/swarm/journal*.ts` family references a sqlite driver, across the
  static/side-effect/dynamic/require spellings), **watcher-no-direct-FS**
  (T1.13 — the watcher family's import-verified node:fs reads never touch
  an expaths-built exchange path; watcher satellites and store-routed reads
  are the sanctioned shapes, and the journal is consumed only through
  `swarm/journal-read.ts`), **single projection writer** (T1.14 — the
  report/q/a/p projection's writer set is exactly the swarm CLI verbs plus
  the named Phase A legacy rows, exact in both directions, with one LIVE
  waiver for the Phase A q-archive rename). Every pin carries canary
  fixtures, precision fixtures and a seeded-file probe walked by the real
  scanner, so a vacuous pin fails its own check.
- **Read API for external UIs: `swarm snapshot` + `swarm events --after
  <seq>` (#30, swarm-core-v1).** The `swarm` CLI now exposes the two
  orchestrator-side read verbs that make it the UI's backend contract (Law
  13: observation clients read the read-model, never files or the database).
  `snapshot` serializes the SwarmGraph with the real dependencies injected
  (journal reader + the configured mode's ManifestStore) — a PURE READ,
  zero writes: in journal mode the manifest scan goes through the read-only
  journal replay (`scanManifestsViaJournalReader`, extracted from the
  journal-backed store so one spelling serves both), never the store
  constructor whose writer open would create/migrate the database. `events
  --after <seq>` exposes the journal cursor reader verbatim and carries the
  DP7 retention counters (`journal.count` / `journal.dbSizeBytes`). Both
  envelopes are versioned contracts (Law 7: `schemaVersion` 1; the snapshot's
  graph carries its own existing stamp) and byte-pinned by goldens in
  `test/swarm-api-check.ts` — every source degraded (no journal, no exchange
  root, no live transport, no usage) still yields a valid snapshot/events
  result with degraded fields, exit 0 (Law 8). The read verbs require no
  worker identity and join the frozen verb surface by addition (§4.1.1).
- **`swarm` CLI — the five worker verbs, Phase A (#18, swarm-core-v1).**
  `bun <extension>/src/swarm/cli.ts read-brief|write-report|ask|poll-answer|write-progress`
  is the worker contract. Phase A output is byte-identical to the file
  writers it replaces (golden/parity checks); raw-path worker prompts keep
  working unchanged.
- **Fleet event journal — SQLite, single-writer, append-only (#22).** One
  shared database at `<agentDir>/delegate-journal/events.db` (WAL,
  `synchronous = FULL`, `user_version = 1` — the Law 7 version gate); the
  closed fourteen-kind set (including `report` — payload = the validated
  report JSON, appended after the atomic publish); bounded `SQLITE_BUSY`
  backoff for cross-process writers; advisory by contract: a journal
  failure can never fail a spawn or collect.
- **Phase B storage flag — journal = truth, files = projection (#23).**
  `swarm.storage: "files" | "journal"` (default `"files"`) and
  `swarm.projection` (default `true`, journal mode only) gate the
  journal-backed ManifestStore: verb writes append journal events first,
  then write the byte-frozen `manifest.json` projection; with
  `projection: false` reads are served by journal replay alone. Parity
  with the file store is check-pinned; the default flip to `"journal"` is
  a separate operator-approved cutover, not bundled here.
- **Resume reconciliation — the honest fleet picture after a reboot
  (#27).** On session start (journal mode) every owned worker's placement
  liveness is probed through the Transport seam; each dead placement gets
  a terminal `dead-reboot` event and each affected fleet exactly one
  `reconcile-summary` wake ("N workers lost to reboot, briefs preserved,
  M reports collected before loss"). Foreign/owner-less rows in
  mixed-ownership fleets are skipped (auditable `skipped` field), never
  marked lost; the run is advisory and never blocks session start.
- **SwarmGraph read-model — the canonical fleet projection (#29).**
  `buildSwarmGraph` is a pure, deterministic, never-throws projection over
  the journal, the manifest store and optional live status; its serialized
  JSON is a versioned contract (`schemaVersion`, Law 7) pinned by a golden
  check. Law 13's read path now has its projection layer; the read API
  (#30) is the next client surface.
### Changed

- **E_PLACE guidance names the sub-orchestrator escape hatch.** The §7
  dictionary hint for `E_PLACE` now states the authority-model rule and the
  working move — a session whose cwd is inside a worktree is a
  sub-orchestrator, worktree placement is rejected there, retry with
  `mode: "shared"` — next to the existing /delegate-teardown remedy (which a
  sub-orchestrator session cannot call). Field lesson: two identical
  orchestrator fleets lost 3 retry turns each on the same E_PLACE because the
  hint named only the unreachable remedy; the tab placement that works was
  never mentioned. Text-only change in the ONE guidance writer (`GUIDANCE`,
  `src/host.ts`); adapters unchanged.

- **The OS launch policy moved below the seam (`src/spawn-policy.ts`).** The
  `cmd.exe` quoting, the shell-wrapper launch shape and the `/T /F` tree-kill
  recipe lived inside the herdr adapter; the rpc backend needs the same OS
  policy, and that vocabulary names the host OS, not a backend. Pure move (the
  helpers are byte-identical), plus one new export — `treeKillCommand`, so no
  backend spells the kill recipe itself. Herdr behavior is unchanged and
  `winQuoteArg` stays in the adapter's export surface (re-export). Pins:
  S1/S2 now allows `src/herdr/cli.ts` exactly the `../spawn-policy.ts`
  specifier and REQUIRES it (the vocabulary may not move back), a new **S1b**
  pins the policy module dependency-free (it sits below both adapters), and S6
  splits the frozen strings into herdr vocabulary (adapter-local) and OS launch
  vocabulary (confined to the policy module, which may never speak herdr).
  `src/herdr/cli.ts` fell under the Law 5 threshold with the move — its
  decomposition row is retired per the ledger convention.

- **Watcher consumes the journal cursor; the delivered-facts store is
  retired (#26, swarm-core-v1).** Wake-up dedup moved from the per-task
  `delivered-<key>.json` files to a durable per-audience journal cursor
  (`cursor-<key>.json`, `src/watch-cursor.ts`): each tick reads
  `eventsAfter(cursor)` through `src/swarm/journal-read.ts` (a throwing read
  skips the tick — advisory by contract, spawn/collect never affected), and a
  successful send commits the delivered facts and advances the cursor `seq`
  only over rows of THIS audience's live fleets (the journal's
  `session_id` + `task` key) — a foreign fleet's rows never move it.
  The wake-up text formats and event names are unchanged; the same fixtures
  through old and new detection produce the same event stream
  (`test/watcher-journal-parity-check.ts`). Ownership verdicts gained a
  journal-row predicate (`journalAudienceMatch`) with the unchanged
  fail-closed semantics; the retire engine (§23) is untouched. First-run
  migration: an absent cursor reads as `seq 0` with no records (never
  seeded) — a single bounded repeat volley on the first post-upgrade session,
  documented as with the stage-B migration.

- **Worker prompt now speaks the `swarm` CLI verbs (#25).** `briefPrompt` instructs
  the worker to interact through `bun <extension>/src/swarm/cli.ts` —
  `read-brief`, `ask`, `poll-answer`, `write-progress`, `write-report` — instead
  of hand-writing exchange files by path. Every example carries explicit
  `--brief` / `--task` / `--worker` flags, so the invocation is
  backend-independent; the exported env vars remain the canonical identity
  when present. The pre-#25 raw-file phrasing survives
  one release as a documented fallback behind the config flag
  `swarm.verbsFallback` (default `true`; `false` drops the fallback paragraph).
  The verb invocation is always the primary instruction; the flag controls only
  the fallback's availability.
- **The spawn flow exports the swarm identity into the worker environment**
  (`StartReq.env`): `SWARM_TASK`, `SWARM_WORKER` and the orchestrator-resolved
  project schema dir `SWARM_SCHEMA_DIR`. The rpc backend delivers it to the child
  process; the herdr backend applies it to the `herdr agent start` CLI subprocess
  (documented propagation caveat).

Regression: `test/report-contract-check.ts` (fallback/verb phrasing),
`test/rpc-host-unit-check.ts` (R9 env delivery), `test/profile-check.ts` (P12
resolver) and the opt-in `test/swarm-verbs-e2e-check.ts` (`RPC_E2E=1`: a live rpc
worker writes its report through `swarm write-report`).

### Fixed

- **The rpc host launches and kills correctly on Windows.** The adapter spawned
  a bare `pi` — on Windows npm installs the `pi.cmd` shim, so the spawn died
  before a worker existed — and killed with `child.kill("SIGKILL")`, which maps
  to TerminateProcess of the DIRECT child: behind the OS launch wrapper that
  kills the wrapper and leaves `pi` (and its children) running, at the
  failed-start rollback and at teardown alike. Both launch and kill now go
  through `src/spawn-policy.ts`: the shell-wrapper launch with per-argument
  quoting, and the `/T /F` tree-kill. POSIX is byte-identical to the previous
  shape (bare `pi`, signal escalation untouched). The policy target is
  injectable (constructor `platform`), so both branches are pinned on any host.
  A field proof on a real Windows host (the live `rpc-host-e2e` leg) exposed one
  more Windows-only consequence: the tree-kill lands asynchronously and the
  worker's cwd IS its worktree placement, which teardown removes immediately
  after — a live process locks its cwd there, so `git worktree remove --force`
  failed `EPERM` and left the worktree behind. The win32 teardown now waits
  (bounded) for the child's real exit; POSIX still resolves right after SIGKILL.
  The header's "POSIX-only for now" gap is closed. Regression:
  `test/rpc-win-launch-check.ts` (P/L/K/R/W — policy units, launch shape,
  teardown kill, rollback kill, teardown ORDERING — no real pi process, no LLM
  traffic).

- **Adaptive sqlite driver — the extension must load under node too.** The
  journal driver prefers `bun:sqlite` and falls back to `node:sqlite`
  (node ≥ 22.13); a statically chosen driver crashed the extension import
  chain under the node runtime, so every rpc worker spawn died `E_START`
  before this fix. Driver choice is confined to `src/swarm/journal-driver.ts`
  (the #31 static pin's confinement glob covers it).
- **Windows-portable config-seam checks — `$HOME` is not the agent dir there,
  and `URL.pathname` is not a path.** Twelve spawn sites across
  `collect-teardown`, `release-on-started`, `retire`, `usage`, `watcher` and
  `double-mount` steered pi's config reader with a fresh `$HOME`; on Windows pi
  resolves the agent dir from `%USERPROFILE%`, so the pinned config was never
  read and every default/override check failed. Each site now also sets the
  documented
  `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`. Five module-path constants (`profile`, `retire`,
  `usage`, `watcher`, `collect-teardown`) and `double-mount`'s ROOT were built
  with `new URL(…, import.meta.url).pathname`, which yields `/C:/...` on
  Windows — the child died `Cannot find module` before any check ran; they now
  use `fileURLToPath`. POSIX is unchanged: there the pinned agent dir is the
  path `$HOME` produced and `fileURLToPath` returns what `.pathname` returned.
- **Windows-portable pins — the QA gate read POSIX separators and `$HOME` as
  universal.** `test/herdr-split-check.ts` classified modules as inside/outside
  `src/herdr/` by comparing against a literal `"/"` while `node:path` yields a
  backslash on Windows, so every herdr file counted as outside and S4/S6 fired
  on the adapter's own files; containment now uses the platform separator, and a
  new S0 canary fails if the literal ever returns. `test/static-check.ts` sent
  the log-sink child to a fresh `$HOME`, which pi's `getAgentDir()` ignores on
  Windows (there the home comes from `%USERPROFILE%`), leaving T4.1b red on a
  green main; the child now pins the documented `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`. POSIX
  launches stay byte-identical.

## [1.18.0] — 2026-09-21

### Removed

- The `/delegate-fleet` full-screen overlay (`fleet-overlay.ts`) and its checks. The ambient fleet widget — the live indicator of running workers — is KEPT (operator decision after the initial removal round); `fleet-widget.ts` was slimmed: the tool-result transcript rendering (`renderDelegateLines`) moved to `ui-text.ts` (consumed by `delegate`, `delegate_status`, `delegate_mailbox`), and the fleet-idle TUI nudge was retired with the overlay. `delegate_status` and `/delegate-teardown` are unchanged. The `delegate-fleet` journal event name is kept (frozen surface).

### Added — Task passport (per-run provenance)

Every delegated run now leaves a passport in the task manifest:

- **Executing version.** Every `delegate` result carries the extension version that
  actually ran the call — both in the human-readable completion line
  (`· pi-delegate vX.Y.Z`) and in the result details (`version`). Single runtime
  source: `src/version.ts`, byte-matched to `package.json` by a static pin
  (Law 9: one artifact, one source of truth).
- **Pre-run git snapshot** (worktree placements only): the checkout's base commit
  and a capped `git status --porcelain` stamped into the worker's manifest entry
  at spawn. Tab placements are deliberately NOT stamped — a tab shares its checkout
  with other workers and the orchestrator, so a snapshot there would falsely attribute
  others' edits to this run.
- **Post-run git delta** (worktree placements only): a capped `git diff --stat`
  plus the untracked-file list, stamped by the same collect that stamps
  `collectedAt` — one write, one witness.
- **Advisory by contract (Law 8).** Both probes are failure-tolerant: a probe
  error or a non-git checkout yields an empty/absent passport and never affects
  spawn or collect.
- **Additive on-disk format (Law 7).** `gitBase` / `gitStatus` / `gitDelta` are
  optional manifest fields; no `schemaVersion` bump.

Regression: `test/passport-check.ts` (P1–P5).

### Changed


- **Default `releaseOn` flipped to `"started"`.** A blocking `delegate` call no longer
  stands in the settle gate for the full 15 s window: as soon as the worker is proven
  started and working, the call releases and the background watcher owns the wait
  (wakes the orchestrator on report-ready / question / death). The old inline block
  never settled a real worker in practice — it only produced a guaranteed timeout
  before the handover. The old behavior stays available as the explicit opt-out:
  `watch.releaseOn: "settle"` in the config or `releaseOn: "settle"` per call (the
  whitelist normalizer now honors exactly `"settle"`; everything else falls back to
  the default `"started"`). Probes are exempt in both modes — their full window IS
  the smoke verdict. Regression: `test/release-on-started-check.ts` (T-rel.4/T-rel.5).

- **Constitution v2 and machine-verified gates.** ARCHITECTURE.md: a direction statement and the eleventh law (independent reviewer agent with a structured verdict file, one canonical serialized main verdict, red-main freeze); the Law 5 module-size threshold is an exact 400 lines with a machine-verified decomposition ledger (the static check computes the over-threshold list and fails CI in both directions); Law 6 waivers are enumerated data, not prose; unfalsifiable wording rewritten to measurable form; audit history moved out per the closed-set law. AGENTS.md: three blocking QA layers (smoke / critical path / regression — no scheduled nightly), the acceptance list as a mandatory PR artifact, the binding-rule conflict rule.
- **Law 5 slice 1 executed.** The pure execute() phases moved from `src/spawn.ts` (2147 → 1833 lines) to the new `src/spawn-phases.ts` (MODULE_CONTRACT); the Law 6 pins updated in the same commit. The stale herdr ledger plan was corrected to the landed split state.
- **Pre-commit smoke gate.** `hooks/pre-commit` (typecheck + static pins, each bounded at 40s); installed via `git config core.hooksPath hooks/`.
- **Runner verdict telemetry.** Every `test/run-checks.sh` verdict line carries host load, available memory and the concurrent-runner count — ENV-FAILs become attributed evidence instead of folklore.
- **Language unification.** The threat catalog and all agent-facing binding documents are now uniformly English; `rpc-jsonl.ts` carries its MODULE_CONTRACT marker.

## [1.17.1] — 2026-09-16
### Added

- **`streamConsole` explicit unsubscribe.** The seam method's return type now
  carries optional `unsubscribe()` — consumers that stop consuming early (a
  closed stream consumer) must call it: a bare for-await break does not
  unregister the subscriber. Contract documented in src/host.ts; pinned by
  `test/stream-seam-check.ts` (unsubscribe spy over a real `FidelityStore`).
- **Named config profiles (gap 0).** Config presets live at
  `~/.pi/agent/pi-delegate.d/<name>.json` (same shape as the base config) and
  are selected by `PI_DELEGATE_PROFILE` (env) or the base config's `"profile"`
  key (env wins). Sections replace the base wholesale; absent sections fall
  through. A selected-but-missing/corrupt profile is a structured `E_START`
  on delegate calls (advisory surfaces degrade to defaults). All config
  readers now route through the single merged view (`src/profile.ts`); with
  no profile selected behavior is byte-identical to before. Regression:
  `test/profile-check.ts`.

- **`"rpc"` worker-host backend (herdr-free delegation).** New config key `"host": "rpc"`
  binds `src/host/rpc.ts` — workers run as headless `pi --mode rpc` child processes of the
  orchestrator session, no herdr anywhere. Worktree placement is a plain `git worktree add`
  under `~/.pi/agent/worktrees/` (sub-orchestrator authority guard mirrors the herdr
  adapter's); prompts go over the worker's stdin (mid-stream submits re-sent as `steer`);
  settle is proven by pi's own `agent_settled` rpc event — event-driven, zero polling, and
  immune to the herdr-era sensor gaps (§19.1b/§19.1c); worker session JSONL is captured via
  `get_state` for the budget gauges; `readConsole` is assembled from captured rpc output
  (assistant text + tool activity) and bound at construction (spawn.ts's probe flow extracts
  it unbound — herdr's `this`-free readConsole survived, this one initially did not);
  extension-UI dialogs are auto-cancelled so a headless worker cannot deadlock. Known
  limitation: rpc workers live with the orchestrator process — after it exits they finish
  and exit (stdin EOF); a later session reads their reports but cannot nudge them. POSIX-only
  for now (bare `pi` spawn, no Windows shim).
  Regression: `test/rpc-host-check.ts` + `test/rpc-host-unit-check.ts` (deterministic, no pi
  subprocess) + `test/host-parity-check.ts` rpc leg (real pi, never prompted — no LLM
  traffic) + `test/rpc-host-e2e-check.ts` (live, opt-in via `RPC_E2E=1`).

- **Full-fidelity worker console streaming (`streamConsole` seam method, rpc backend).**
  New OPTIONAL `Transport` method `streamConsole?(name, opts?: { afterSeq? }): AsyncIterable<ConsoleEvent>`
  (src/host.ts) — same optionality pattern as `readConsole`: implementations without an event
  store omit it (herdr adapter and the fake host do) and callers probe with
  `typeof transport.streamConsole === "function"` and degrade to `readConsole` polling. The
  envelope is `ConsoleEvent` (workerName, seq, timestamp, kind, payload — raw text, no
  re-encoding). The rpc adapter implements it: its stdout pump (single writer) mirrors every
  parsed rpc record into a new per-host `FidelityStore` (src/stream-seam/) — drop-oldest ring
  capped at 20,000 events per worker (~4.6 MB/worker at realistic payload sizes, ~235 MB at 50
  workers), replay-from-cursor exact and gap-free within the retained window, seq numbers
  monotonic across eviction, a backlog truncated by eviction opens with a `gap` marker naming
  the first retained seq (the `readConsole` last-maxChars snapshot stays the fallback beyond
  the window), and slow subscribers get drop-with-gap-marker backpressure (one merged marker
  naming the recovery cursor; per-subscriber memory O(bufferLimit)). Subscribers attach via
  `afterSeq`; teardown releases the worker's ring. Zero new data sources — fidelity
  preservation of the stream the pump already received. Regression: `test/stream-seam-check.ts`
  + the rpc leg `test/rpc-stream-check.ts`.

- **Dialog-relay policy flag (rpc backend, additive, default OFF).** New rpc adapter option
  `dialogRelay` (default false — behavior byte-identical to the auto-cancel default: blocking
  extension-UI dialogs are answered `cancelled: true` over stdin exactly as before, proven by
  the byte-identical stdin-write assertion in `test/rpc-stream-check.ts`). When enabled, a
  blocking dialog offer is relayed onto the console stream as a `dialog` ConsoleEvent and stays
  pending (status honestly reads `blocked`); the consumer answers via the adapter-level
  `answerDialog()` method, which writes the same raw `extension_ui_response` stdin command the
  auto-cancel path writes (the `rpcCommand` correlation wrapper would clobber the dialog's wire
  id). Fire-and-forget UI records (setWidget/notify/…) mirror as `ui` ConsoleEvents only when
  the flag is on. Regression: `test/rpc-stream-check.ts` (S4–S6).
### Changed
### Removed
## [1.17.0] — 2026-09-12

The healing release: the four-way 2026-09-11 audit of the 1.16.1 line turned into law and executed across waves 0–4 (see STABILIZATION.md and the new ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Added

- **Session-keyed watcher lifecycle (Law 3).** Every `session_start` builds a per-session context; the watcher mount is keyed by session file and a SECOND mount for the same session is refused instead of silently running two watchers with independent dedup. Regression: `test/double-mount-check.ts`.
- **Output truncation caps (Law 1).** Every tool return path that carries worker-written content is bounded by pi's own truncation helpers: `delegate_status` rows capped at 100 with an "N more omitted" note (full list in the result details), report summaries/artifacts and mailbox question bodies truncated with an explicit pointer to the full copy. Regression: `test/status-cap-check.ts`, `test/text-cap-check.ts`.
- **Versioned on-disk formats (Law 7).** `schemaVersion` stamped on the manifest, mailbox/release envelopes and the nudge-failed marker; readers tolerate absent (v1) and reject wrong versions. Regression: `test/schema-version-check.ts`.
- **fsync before rename** in the one atomic file writer (open/write/fsync/close/rename) — crash-consistent durable writes.
- **`prepareArguments` shim** on the delegate tool folding legacy `timeoutMs` calls into `waitMs` (schema stays strict).
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — the ten-law constitution binding all future developer agents; both AGENTS.md levels point at it.

### Changed

- **Fleet UI is registry-driven (Law 9).** The ambient fleet widget and the `/delegate-fleet` overlay render from the fleet registry read-model (`snapshot()`/`tree()`/`subscribe()`) instead of each running its own `manifestStore` scan + `listStatuses` poll; the widget additionally refreshes on the registry's advisory events. Row assembly is one implementation (`buildWorkerViewsFromSource` → `buildWidgetRows`); liveness comes from the registry's status poll (a `retiredAt` worker reads done — console closed). Advisory invariants unchanged (failed reads keep the last snapshot; spawn/collect untouched); ownership glyphs, fold, mega-fold and width clamps unchanged. The shared text helpers moved to the leaf `src/ui-text.ts` (one implementation for widget, overlay and detail pane). Regression: `test/fleet-source-check.ts` (registry↔legacy parity, event-driven refresh, degradation, dispose teardown).
- **placementRef-only seam (Law 4).** `workspaceId`/`paneId` are now optional compatibility fields on `Placement`; `placementRef` is the only required handle — a second backend (tmux) no longer must fake herdr-shaped ids. Parity pinned by `test/host-parity-check.ts`.
- **Decomposition to layout v3 (Law 5).** The exchange/observe/spawn god-modules split into single-responsibility modules (archive, manifest-store, report-schema, mailbox-store, watch-store; watch-config, watch-detect, watcher, watch-retire, status-tool, commands; tool-result, clock, grace, mailbox-tool) with the duplicate helper clusters deduplicated (fs-probe, text-cap, one mailbox-state reader, one audit sink). Verbatim moves; the user-visible surface (tool names, params, commands, E_* codes) is unchanged.
- **Cheaper watcher tick.** Satellite stamp layers are mtime-cached per mount and the session-JSONL tail parse is fingerprint-gated — no more up-to-1MB re-reads per worker per tick. Regression: `test/watch-tick-cost-check.ts`.
- **Release machinery.** Both CI workflows run the deterministic `test/run-checks.sh` (no silent `|| bun test` fallback), a changelog-section PR gate, a release-run concurrency group, and a pinned bun version.
- **typebox moved to peerDependencies** per pi's packaging contract.
- **Single-sourced skill (Law 9).** The stale repo-root `pi/skills/delegate` copy is deleted; both install layouts load the extension's copy.

### Changed (restored 2026-09-21 — shipped with 1.17.0; misplaced out of this section during the release edit)

### Changed

- **Herdr vocabulary retired in favor of backend-neutral terms.** The worker's
  output/readback surface is now the **worker console**: the transport seam method
  `readPane` is `readConsole`, and prose, guidance strings and comments say
  "console read", "console readback" and "Worker console not at prompt". The
  shared-checkout placement is now **shared placement**: the `delegate` tool's `mode`
  parameter accepts `"shared"` — "placement in the shared checkout without
  isolation" — and the existing `"tab"` value keeps working as a deprecated alias,
  normalized to the same placement (the on-disk manifest `kind` value stays `"tab"`,
  frozen while older sessions read those manifests). The herdr-shaped legacy id
  fields keep their names and are described as "legacy alternate id
  (herdr-shaped)"; consumers keep preferring `placementRef`. The herdr backend itself
  is untouched: herdr CLI strings, the JSON field names parsed from herdr output,
  manifest `kind` values, journal event names, tool names/params, the
  `not_linked_worktree` token and every `E_*` error code stay byte-identical.

- **An orchestrator session running in a directory where a worker once ran
  again receives wake-ups (stage C mount-gate fix).** The mount gate
  (`isWorkerSession`) used to classify any session whose cwd equals a worker
  entry's `placement.checkoutPath` as that worker — so a fresh orchestrator
  started in a worktree where an earlier worker had run silently mounted no
  watcher and lost every child wake-up (reproduced in live acceptance
  testing). Worker identity on the mount side is now proven ONLY by the
  entry's own `sessionPath` (the worker session's JSONL path); the
  checkoutPath === cwd branch is removed as ambiguous by construction (shared-
  placement workers always share the orchestrator's checkout, and a historical entry
  poisoned the gate for every future session in that cwd). Unproven reads as
  "not a worker" and the session mounts — safe because delivery stays
  fail-closed (watcher stage A): a mounted watcher without a proven identity
  never produces a wrong wake. Consequences of the same fix: the in-loop
  self/leaf-worker suppression also matches by sessionPath only, and a
  degraded tier-1 lead (unreadable session id) now mounts a watcher but
  still wakes for nothing (the fail-closed edge lives on the delivery side,
  guideline §3.6).

- **A worker that ends without a report is now reported explicitly (watcher
  stage C — explicit result-plane states).** The `worker-dead` wake now also
  fires for a worker that SETTLED (done/idle, still known to herdr) without
  ever writing a report — previously that state was silent; only the
  gone-from-host shape woke anyone. Both shapes name the missing report and
  the failed-spawn move, carry the same launch-stamp episode fingerprint, and
  are committed to the durable delivery store like every other kind. The
  missing-report branch is deliberately not silenced by the `collectedAt`
  stamp (that stamp suppresses only the report-branch wake-ups). A corrupt
  `q-<name>.json` mailbox file (exists but is not valid JSON or not a question
  envelope) is now audited in the watcher log with its cause instead of being
  silently treated as "no question" — it still produces no wake-up and is
  never masked as a report event. No ownership or delivery behavior changed:
  unreliable result files never widen the wake-up audience.
- **Watcher wake-up delivery now survives a session restart (watcher stage
  B — durable delivery store).** The delivered-facts dedup left the memory of
  one watcher mount: each audience session commits its delivery records to
  `delivered-<key>.json` in the task directory (one file per session per
  task dir, atomic write, tolerant read) and only AFTER a successful
  wake-up send — a failed send never touches the disk, and a failed durable
  write is not a failed delivery (an audit line notes the possible repeat
  after a restart). Repeated wake-ups on the same files after a session
  restart are therefore gone. A report the collect tool already accepted
  (the manifest `collectedAt` stamp) still never produces a delivery record
  — the store holds only really-sent wakes. Emergency rollback to the
  memory-only dedup without a new version: `watch.durableDelivery: false`
  (default true; a non-boolean value warns once and stays true). One-time
  behavior on upgrade: the first run on a RESUMED session may emit a single
  volley of repeated wake-ups — the store starts empty and is never seeded
  (seeding would guess what was delivered; the volley is bounded by the
  ownership gate and the 24 h lookback). On a shared machine, updated and
  not-yet-updated sessions behave differently until all are updated.
- **Watcher wake-up delivery is fail-closed by default (watcher stage A).**
  A manifest with no owner fields anywhere (legacy) no longer delivers
  wake-ups to every mounted watcher; only a proven owner session is woken.
  The single rollback is the explicit config key `watch.legacyFailOpen:
  true`, which restores the old legacy delivery and is unsafe on a machine
  with several sessions (bystander wakes return). A session that cannot read
  its own identity delivers nothing unconditionally — this edge has no
  configuration escape. Skipped deliveries are recorded in the watcher audit
  file (`~/.pi/agent/delegate-watch.log`) with the reason; a spawn that
  could not record an owner path warns the orchestrator explicitly.

### Fixed

- **Google-model-breaking enum parameter shape:** tool enums use `StringEnum` instead of `Type.Union` of literals.
- **Hardcoded `~/.pi/agent` paths** (7 sites) replaced by pi's `getAgentDir()`/`CONFIG_DIR_NAME` exports, with a static pin banning literal joins.
- **Double-delivery bug class closed:** accept-then-log delivery classification ("accepted by pi" counts as delivered; rollback only for genuine pre-delivery failures — `test/watcher-check.ts` W19) and the watcher-vs-collect `collectedAt` race (report wake dropped when the stamp lands between snapshot and send — W20).
- **Lying contracts corrected** (seam module header, fleet stale fail-open paragraph); six production TypeScript errors resolved; `tsc --noEmit` is now a gate; both commands guard dialog/notify calls with `ctx.hasUI`.
- **Silent-catch residue surfaced:** archive failures carry a reason, start-failure manifest-rollback failures are logged, audit-append failures are counted. Regression: `test/silent-catch-check.ts`.
- **False worker-dead for worker-orchestrators:** a worker that ended its turn while its own fleet was still running was classified "settled with no report", causing retries and E_NAME collisions; now the parent watcher sees the in-flight fleet and gets an honest `fleet-in-flight` state instead. Regression: `test/watcher-check.ts` (new block).
- **Schema-violating reports self-heal:** a report rejected at collect (e.g. `status: "done"`) no longer forces a full re-spawn — the watcher automatically posts a fix steer (the exact validator error) to a live worker, which rewrites the report in place; the report-invalid guidance is cheapest-first (steer first, re-spawn only if the worker is gone) and the spawn prompt carries a status anti-example. Regression: `test/watcher-check.ts` (+ auto-nudge block), `test/report-contract-check.ts` (prompt pin).

### Windows path support

- **Windows default exchange root.** On Windows the default exchange root is now
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pi\exchange` (fallback `homedir()\AppData\Local\pi\exchange`); the
  `PI_DELEGATE_EXCHANGE_ROOT` environment variable overrides it (absolute path). The
  POSIX default `/tmp/exchange` is unchanged in this release.
- **Single portable path builder.** Every exchange-layer path (manifest, brief, report,
  mailbox, probe dir, teardown log) is assembled through the platform-aware builder
  `src/expaths.ts` (`node:path`, injectable in tests) — no more mixed-separator paths
  from raw `/` template literals. POSIX output stays byte-identical to previous
  releases.
- **No spurious `E_BRIEF` on Windows.** Brief validation (`ensureExchangeDir`) compares
  directories case- and separator-stable on Windows (`c:\…` vs `C:\…`, `/` vs `\`);
  POSIX comparison remains exact.
- **Windows-correct classification and ownership.** Fleet grouping slugs and probe-dir
  classification are separator-agnostic; the session-owner compare
  (`sameSessionPath`, `src/watch-role.ts`) folds case and separators on Windows only —
  a case-differing POSIX path still reads as foreign.
- **herdr adapter on Windows.** Worktree containment uses a segment-aware compare;
  the Windows CLI launch policy is `cmd.exe /d /s /c` with per-argument quoting and
  `windowsHide`; kill escalation on Windows is `taskkill /pid … /T /F`. The POSIX
  SIGTERM→SIGKILL escalation is unchanged.
- **Scope note.** Windows-shaped tests (path.win32 fixtures) run on the POSIX CI; a
  real-Windows E2E run is not part of CI — it stays an explicit manual QA gate. The
  exchange/path layer is Windows-portable in 1.17.0; running the host backend on Windows
  requires herdr for Windows.

### Removed

- **DESIGN.md** — the frozen historical design log (v1 → v1.17.0) — removed from the repo and the npm package; decision history lives in git.


## [1.16.1] — 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Migration stage 1 (architecture-audit steps 1–4, behavior-preserving hardening):
  - Shared conventions extracted to exported constants: staleness threshold
    (duplicate copies in observe.ts and fleet.ts replaced by one import),
    config path, probes directory, teardown journal format, repeat-mandate text.
  - Error codes are now carried on typed error objects instead of being parsed
    from message text; new codes for teardown failure and status-read failure;
    guidance hints produced by a single factory with adapter-supplied detail.
  - Teardown results carry a structured `alreadyGone` field — closing an
    absent worker is no longer an error; regex-based "not found" detection
    removed; adapter parity check extended to cover the new field.

## [1.16.0] — 2026-09-10

### Changed

- **WorkerHost inversion (migration complete)**: the herdr boundary is now a
  backend-neutral seam (`src/host.ts`, type name `Transport` kept) plus a
  herdr adapter (`src/herdr/host.ts`) bound once in `index.ts` from the
  config's `"host"` key (default `herdr`; unknown value → structured error).
  The `src/transport.ts` re-export shim is deleted. Zero behavior change on
  the herdr path; the in-memory fake (`src/host/fake.ts`) ships as the
  second adapter (PoC promoted).
- **Opaque `placementRef` threading**: `StartReq` is keyed by an
  adapter-defined `placementRef` (herdr ids left the seam read model —
  `AgentStatus` is `{name, status, placementRef?}`); spawn manifest
  dedup/rollback matches on name+placementRef with a legacy-paneId fallback;
  the retire closeability gate is ref-aware.
- **Neutralized texts**: all 19 model/user-facing herdr-specific command
  names in tool descriptions, event messages and error guidance replaced
  with backend-neutral phrasing (retry/mailbox/escalation semantics
  unchanged); herdr CLI recipes stay inside adapter error messages.
- **Watcher log UX**: routine watcher bookkeeping (e.g. retire successes) no
  longer surfaces in the pane — every line goes to the audit file
  `~/.pi/agent/delegate-watch.log`; the pane shows only errors and anomalies.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate report-ready wake-ups (true defect, diag D1)**: the watcher's
  dedup state reset treated a no-observation tick (transient report ENOENT)
  as "condition stopped being true" and forgot fingerprinted seen-keys —
  the same report fired twice with an UNCHANGED mtime. Fingerprinted kinds
  keep their key until the worker vanishes or the fingerprint changes
  (regression: W16.16).
- **Foreign-fleet wake broadcast narrowed (diag B1)**: the ownership gate
  consults the manifest-level `masterSessionPath` when a worker entry lacks
  `orchestratorSessionPath` — a known foreign owner stays silent; fail-open
  remains only for manifests with no owner field anywhere (W14.18–W14.23).
- **Archive-at-retire**: a TTL auto-retire of an UNCOLLECTED worker no
  longer orphans its report — retirePass archives the report + manifest
  snapshot before teardown (idempotent; retire-check R7).
- **herdr tab-id drift (implement-osb field report)**: herdr renamed the
  tab-create result key `tab.id` → `tab.tab_id`; the parser missed the new
  spelling and recorded the PANE id as `tabId`, so every autonomous tab close
  failed `tab_not_found` while the agent stayed alive (the paneId fallback
  also masked the failure as an idempotent retire). The parser now reads the
  current spelling (legacy accepted), `AgentStatus` carried `tabId` during
  the transition, and teardown re-resolves the live tab id from the herdr
  registry when the recorded one carries the broken paneId-fallback signature.
- **Worktree teardown idempotency (parity-pin find)**: a SECOND teardown of
  an already-removed worktree failed E_PLACE with herdr
  `workspace_not_found`; the seam contract (and the fake, and the tool
  layer's already-gone handling) requires a no-op success. Not-found-shaped
  removal errors are now idempotent in the herdr adapter.
- **`/delegate-teardown` output**: manifest history entries (retired workers
  are never deleted) are skipped with a count instead of being attempted —
  no more wall of `tab_not_found` errors for long-closed workers; a
  not-found close inside the command is a clean "already closed, no-op".
- **Stale nudge-failed marker**: a same-name retry deletes any leftover
  marker at spawn (a fresh watcher session would re-fire it once).
- **Fixture hygiene / manifest scan backend gate** (field lesson
  2026-09-10): a test manifest written into the live /tmp/exchange root
  woke a bystander orchestrator through the fail-open legacy scan. The scan
  now drops entries whose placement declares a non-empty backend other than
  the active host; the exchange root is overridable via
  `$PI_DELEGATE_EXCHANGE_ROOT` and all test fixtures sandbox under mkdtemp
  dirs.
- Root `package.json` version synced to the extension's (1.15.1 divergence).

### Added

- **F6 — two-tier delegation wake-up**: a session that is a worker of a parent
  manifest AND the orchestrator of its own child manifests (a tier-1 lead)
  now mounts a watcher scoped to ITS OWN children — tier-2 report-ready/
  mailbox-question wakes the lead without meta-orchestrator nudges. The
  pre-existing `createWatcher` leafWorker mute is scoped the same way.
- **Mailbox nudge resilience**: the answer/steer pane nudge retries with
  backoff (3 attempts); on repeated failure a watcher-visible
  `nudge-failed-<name>.json` marker delivers the wake-up on the next tick
  instead of the socket (kind `nudge-failed`, fingerprint = marker ts).
- **Trunk-based development + CI**: PR-gated squash-only flow (AGENTS.md);
  GitHub Actions — `ci.yml` (bun check suite + package.json version sync on
  every PR) and `release.yml` (on main: rerun suite → semver tag → GitHub
  Release with notes from the fresh CHANGELOG section).
- **host-parity pin** (`test/host-parity-check.ts`): one place → manifest →
  teardown flow asserted on BOTH adapters — fake always (CI), real herdr
  behind the existing `herdr --version` skip guard.
- Static pins re-targeted after the split: T1.1d (the seam imports node
  builtins only), T1.1c positive pin (only index.ts imports the adapter).

### Fixed

- **herdr tab-id drift (implement-osb field report)**: herdr renamed the
  tab-create result key `tab.id` → `tab.tab_id`; the parser missed the new
  spelling and recorded the PANE id as `tabId`, so every autonomous tab close
  failed `tab_not_found` while the agent stayed alive (the paneId fallback
  also masked the failure as an idempotent retire). The parser now reads the
  current spelling (legacy accepted), `AgentStatus` carries `tabId`, and
  teardown re-resolves the live tab id from the herdr registry when the
  recorded one carries the broken paneId-fallback signature.
- **Retire pass idempotency**: a herdr "not found" during the autonomous
  close (pane already gone) is treated as a successful retire — no more
  `tab_not_found` error spam every tick; genuine teardown failures keep the
  advisory retry.
- **`/delegate-teardown` output**: manifest history entries (retired workers
  are never deleted) are skipped with a count instead of being attempted —
  the command no longer prints a wall of `tab_not_found` errors for
  long-closed workers; a not-found close inside the command is a clean
  "already closed, no-op" success (parity with the retire pass).
- **Stale nudge-failed marker**: a same-name retry deletes any leftover
  marker at spawn (a fresh watcher session would re-fire it once).
- `nudgeFailedPathFor`/`readNudgeFailedMarker` moved to `exchange.ts`
  (module boundary — exchange-dir conventions live there).
- Root `package.json` version synced to the extension's (1.15.1 divergence).
- Legacy fail-open ownership for worker-orchestrators is pinned by tests
  (W16.14/W16.15) — a deliberate policy, now a conscious one.

### Changed

- README rebuilt bilingual (EN/RU) with header cross-links; the field case
  study and client identifiers removed from the public surface (NDA scrub).
- **Watcher log UX**: routine watcher bookkeeping (e.g. routine retire
  successes) no longer surfaces in the pane — every line goes to the audit
  file `~/.pi/agent/delegate-watch.log`; the pane shows only errors and
  anomalies (close failures, "pane was already gone").

## [1.15.0] — 2026-09-09

### Added

- **Fleet usage accounting (F1)** — persistent per-task accounting for every
  delegate fleet: total output tokens, prompt-cache hits, sent volume (input-
  token proxy), worker count; a fleet description (3–10 words, derived once
  from the first brief of the task) and a link to the master orchestrator's
  session log (`masterSessionPath`) are stored in the task manifest and never
  overwritten. Aggregates are recomputed from worker session files on read
  (cached snapshot in the manifest with `computedAt`); missing or corrupt
  session files yield partial totals with a marker instead of an error.

#### How to use fleet usage accounting

After a fleet has run, call `delegate_status` (or `/delegate-fleet`) — each
task dir now prints one aggregate line after the per-worker rows:

```
fleet rng-sum "delegate random number summation": ↓1.2k out · cache 840 · sent 3.1k · 8 workers
```

`↓out` = total output tokens, `cache` = prompt-cache reads, `sent` = input-
token proxy for data sent. `[partial: …]` names workers whose session files
were missing/corrupt. Totals are read-only — no config needed; the numbers
live in the task's `manifest.json` (`usage` section) and survive restarts.

### Changed

- **Layout v2: 7 flat modules** — the src/{tools,transport,ui} taxonomy is
gone; src/ is now `index.ts` (wiring only) + `spawn.ts` (delegate+mailbox
pipeline), `observe.ts` (status tool, watcher, config), `fleet.ts` (all
UI + ownership + worker views), `exchange.ts` (report/manifest/mailbox
lifecycle + archive), `transport.ts` (herdr boundary, E_* taxonomy),
`usage.ts` (unchanged). Every module opens with a ZCS MODULE_CONTRACT
header naming the invariants it owns (DESIGN.md "layout v2").

### Fixed

- **Report-contract precedence** — the injected report contract now
explicitly overrides a conflicting brief OUTPUT section (rng-sum incident:
a worker wrote `{"number": 6}` and failed schema validation).
- **Retriable E_REPORT_INVALID/E_REPORT_MISSING** — retry guidance now
mandates a NEW suffixed worker name (`<name>-r2`); the original name stays
taken by the settled agent.
- **Phantom manifest entries** — a refused spawn (E_START) no longer leaves a
manifest entry without `sessionPath` (rollback in the startAgent catch,
append-before-start teardown invariant preserved).
- **Mailbox reaches Done workers** — `delegate_mailbox` steer/answer now
wakes a settled worker via a new turn instead of silently dropping the
mail; honest no-op warning for unknown status.
- **`reportSchema` echo** — a brief-declared report JSON Schema is echoed
into the worker prompt, so workers write against the schema they are
validated against.
- **§23 retire (opt-in)** — auto-teardown of drained worker panes, disabled
by default: enable `watch.retire: true` (+ `watch.retireTtlMs`, default
900000); off by default, behavior unchanged when off.
- **Portable worktree paths** — `WORKTREE_DIR` resolved via `os.homedir()`
instead of a hardcoded `/root/...`; new static check bans `/root/` literals
in src/.

### Tests

- Regression pins for all four fixes above (red/green proven), new
`fleet-usage-check.ts` (21 checks), `mailbox-check.ts` (17), retire
R1–R6 matrix; 14 runnable suites + tsc green.

## [1.14.2] — 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **No more duplicate `report-ready` wake-ups across session restarts** —
  field incident (2026-09-08): an orchestrator
  verified a landed report WITHOUT a formal collect (manual read + commit
  verification), so no `collectedAt` was ever stamped; every session restart
  re-fired report-ready for the same accepted report — the watcher's `seen`
  dedup is session-scoped memory, and the gap is cross-session. Fix in
  `src/watch.ts` + `src/exchange.ts` (DESIGN.md §21):
  - New manifest field `notifiedReportMtime` (stringified report mtimeMs):
    after a SUCCESSFUL batch send the watcher stamps the delivered report
    fingerprint into the manifest worker. The watcher — reader of every other
    manifest field — becomes a writer of exactly this one; `collect` leaves it
    untouched.
  - Detection gates `report-ready`/`report-invalid` on
    `String(reportMtime) !== notifiedReportMtime` alongside the `collectedAt`
    gate: a fresh session no longer re-wakes on an already-announced report.
  - Fingerprint-keyed, so a REWRITTEN report (new mtime) re-arms normally;
    `collectedAt` still outranks (collected reports stay silent regardless).
  - Advisory by contract: stamping is mutation-queue-serialized, idempotent,
    failure-logged and swallowed (can only cost a duplicate wake, never a
    lost one); a FAILED delivery stamps nothing — the batch re-fires while
    still true.
- **Tests**: new `test/watcher-notify-check.ts` (N1–N8, 17 checks): fire →
  stamp → fresh-session silence, rewritten-report re-arm, collectedAt
  precedence, failed-delivery rollback, mixed-batch stamping (question +
  report), report-invalid symmetry. Verified live against the incident
  manifest: tick 1 wakes and stamps, a fresh-session tick stays silent.

## [1.14.1] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **Skill no longer pulls the orchestrator into the manual herdr ritual** —
  field: asking the model to delegate sometimes loaded the skill and followed
  REFERENCE.md's manual herdr CLI spawn ritual instead of calling the
  `delegate` tool. Two causes fixed in `pi/skills/delegate`:
  - REFERENCE.md carried skill frontmatter with the same aggressive trigger
    description — a competing pseudo-skill whose body IS the manual ritual;
    frontmatter removed (it is a sub-doc, not a skill).
  - SKILL.md buried the tool-first rule mid-paragraph; now a non-negotiable
    lead rule: tool in the tool list → the ONLY spawn/collect path; the
    ritual is for sessions where the extension is missing; topologies and
    anti-patterns stay valid reading. E_TIMEOUT row updated to the v1.14
    watcher discipline (end turn, watcher wakes).

### Added

- **Bundle manifest** — the repo root is now an installable pi package
  (`pi.extensions` + `pi.skills`): pi-delegate extension and the delegate
  skill ship together from one source of truth. The loose copies under
  `~/.pi/agent/{extensions,skills}` are retired to
  `delegate-archive/*-prebundle`; `pi install git:github.com/Evreke/ai-sandbox`
  (or the local path) replaces manual syncing.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **Early release on started worker (`watch.releaseOn: "started"`)** — field
  (delegate tab obpl-fix/calc-fix, 2026-09-07): the delegate call blocked the
  full settle gate even after the worker was already observed working — the
  orchestrator sat parked for 15–20 s per fan-out while the only remaining
  outcome was the §21 handoff. New `watch.releaseOn` config (values `settle`
  default / `started`) plus a per-call `releaseOn` param: once `waitSettle`
  observes the worker working, the call returns a success-shaped
  "orchestrator released" result (`startedConfirmed: true`) and the
  end-your-turn discipline applies immediately. Spawn failures are still
  caught (they precede the first working observation); fast inline settles
  (within one wait slice) still return the report synchronously; probes are
  exempt — their full window IS the verdict. DESIGN.md §20.5/§22.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **Fleet overlay self-describing fold + stale ordering + legend parity
  (fleet-UX wave 4)** — read-only-display fixes from the verified UX
  investigation (report-lex/report-act/report-pulse); DESIGN.md §15/§22.3:
  - **Self-describing folded lines** (report-lex fix 1): the folded grammar
    `~ owner.slug xN -- L B ! Q v s` (memorization burden 11) is retired for
    `~ <class> <slug> · N workers · counts… · idle <age>` — class token
    space-separated from the slug (the dot-join read as a hostname), no bare
    `xN`, no `--` separator, no letter flags; counts are words (live /
    blocked / hot-ctx (≥CONTEXT_WARN_PCT) / question / rep), non-zero only,
    old flag order. Identity (class + slug + worker count) LEADS the line so
    fitRow's left-to-right degrade keeps it under width pressure. Mega-line
    uses the same vocabulary, stays one line, mixed tag stays truthful
    (`foreign+owner?`).
  - **Stale age tail with ownership-scoped remedy** (report-lex fix 2 ∘
    report-act fix 3): the `s` letter's exact condition (isFleetStale —
    every member collected ≥30 min, semantics unchanged) now renders as
    `idle <age>` carrying the OLDEST member's collectedAt age (`31m`,
    `3h46m`); no stamp → no tail. Remedy is scoped: mine groups read
    `… (/delegate-teardown)`, foreign/`owner?` groups read `… · owner can
    tear down` — the global sweep is never advertised to bystanders.
  - **Foreign-fleet framing line** (report-act fix 1): when any
    foreign/`owner?` group is on screen, one dim legend line states the
    viewer's role: `○ ◌ = another session's fleet — informational; only its
    owner can act` (affirms the §22 canon).
  - **Legend parity** (report-lex fix 3): FLAT legend gains keys for tokens
    its surface renders but never explained — `owner?` untraceable, the `—`
    probe dash, `├└ group`, `↑↓ in/out`. FOLD legend becomes a one-line
    WORKED EXAMPLE of the new grammar plus a minimal key (live=working/
    blocked · rep=report landed · idle=collected ≥30m). Each legend packs
    greedily into at most two physical dim lines (`packLegend`, one when it
    fits).
  - **Stale-aware ordering + window trim** (report-pulse fix 2): ONE new
    `rankGroups` tiebreak layer — fully-stale groups sort below
    otherwise-equal groups (after class rank, before slug); in the height
    window, fresh blocks fill first and fully-stale blocks are admitted
    only after every fresh block is shown, so a live (working/blocked) row
    is never hidden while a stale-group row is visible. Group-atomic
    guarantee kept; NO admission changes — every manifest worker still
    renders (archived tier explicitly out of scope).

### Changed

- Expanded MY flat rows are byte-identical (verified against the regenerated
  goldens); widget (fleet-ui.ts), watch.ts, commands.ts, tools/* untouched.
  Chrome grows by up to 2 lines (second legend line + framing), shrinking
  the height window accordingly; window goldens moved to terminalRows 12.

### Tests

- `test/fleet-tree-check.ts`: folded-grammar expectations updated to the new
  grammar (H3–H5, G3b, S2–S5, W2b) and new cases added — W5 age formatting,
  W6 mine-vs-foreign remedy scoping, W7/W7b stale ordering tiebreak (and
  class-rank precedence), W8/W8b/W8c stale-aware trim priority, W9–W9e
  legend parity + framing line + packLegend two-line cap. All goldens
  deliberately regenerated (the diff is the review artifact).
- All check scripts green except `transport-contract` (known env-broken:
  live herdr spawn — unchanged).

## [1.12.1] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **Lifecycle hygiene — teardown-after-collect + `worker-stale` + fleet `s`
  flag (fleet-UX wave 3; user decisions locked: default ON, grace 0, only on
  VALID collect, foreign fleets never mutated)** — DESIGN.md §22:
  - **Teardown-after-collect** (`delegate` tool): after a successful strict
    collect (report valid, `collectedAt` stamped) the worker is torn down
    automatically via the transport with its recorded placement. Skips:
    probes (panes stay this wave), `collect.teardownAfterCollect: false`, and
    a pending `q-<name>.json` (the worker is still in a conversation).
    Invalid/failed collects never reach the hook (the pane is needed for
    diagnose). **Advisory by contract**: the hook can only append a note —
    `Auto-teardown: …` or `Warning: … collect unaffected` — to the already-
    decided result; no failure alters a collect outcome or throws past the
    tool boundary. Audit lines mirror the `/delegate-teardown` format into
    the same `<dir>/teardown.log`, suffixed `(auto-after-collect)`.
  - **`resolveCollectConfig`** (`src/watch.ts`, beside `resolveWatchConfig`):
    `collect.teardownAfterCollect`, default **true**, tolerant — missing/
    corrupt/non-boolean → default, never throws.
  - **`worker-stale` watcher event** (§21 union): manifest `collectedAt`
    older than `watch.staleAfterMs` (new key, default 30 min, floor 60 s) and
    the worker still live → "collected N min ago and still mounted — tear it
    down (/delegate-teardown) or keep". Fingerprint = `collectedAt` (a
    re-collect re-arms); silent when not live / herdr unreachable / stamp
    unparseable; the ownership gate already silences foreign fleets and is
    not bypassed. `startWatcher` threads the config threshold.
  - **`s` flag in the fleet overlay** (folded group grammar): appended after
    `L B ! Q v`, non-zero-only, = EVERY member collected ≥30 min ago
    (stale-idle; one fresh member suppresses the group claim). Pure
    `isFleetStale` + injectable render clock; shares the watcher's 30-min
    default; legend gains `s stale`; no new fs reads (rides the manifest the
    overlay already reads). Widget untouched.

### Tests

- New `test/collect-teardown-check.ts` + `collect-teardown-driver.ts`: the
  C1 config matrix, C2 valid → torn down exactly once / invalid / q-pending /
  probe / teardown-throws → collect still succeeds (real `execute()` over a
  mock transport, child-process `$HOME`), C3 config-off, C4 static pins
  (guard order, advisory shape, commands.ts audit mirror).
- `watcher-check.ts`: W15 (fires once, re-arms on re-collect, suppressions,
  foreign-owner silence, key fingerprint, threshold config W2.8–W2.10).
- `fleet-tree-check.ts`: S1–S6 (`s` threshold matrix, every-member rule,
  flag order, mega threading) + folded goldens regenerated for the `s stale`
  legend + V11/V12 `s`-flag goldens (fixed clock).
- All check scripts green except `transport-contract` (known env-broken:
  live herdr spawn — unchanged).

## [1.12.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- **Ownership display — fleet-UX stage 1 (glyph + attention-gated fold +
  fitter fix)**: /tmp/exchange manifests are cross-session, so both fleet
  surfaces now say whose workers they are showing. Variant A "Glyph & fold"
  from the fleet-UX design wave (report-ux-own.json), widget policy per user
  decision (attention-gated):
  - **classifyOwnership** (new `src/ownership.ts`, pure): manifest
    `orchestratorSessionPath` === this session's `getSessionFile()` → mine;
    present+different → foreign; absent/empty (legacy manifest) → UNKNOWN.
    Degraded self-id falls back to the worktree `checkoutPath === cwd` match
    (mirrors watch.ts isSelf); tab workers are NEVER matched by cwd. Display
    is FAIL-CLOSED — unknown never renders as mine (deliberate asymmetry vs
    the watcher's fail-open).
  - **Overlay** (`/delegate-fleet`): the row's lead space became an ownership
    glyph column — ● mine (accent), ○ foreign (muted), ◌ legacy (dim) — and
    the legend gained `● mine ○ foreign ◌ legacy`.
  - **Widget** (ambient live rows): MY live rows are byte-identical to
    before; foreign/legacy live workers fold into at most one line per class
    (≤2 total): `○ N foreign live (task1, task2)` / `◌ N legacy live (…)`.
    A class line appears ONLY when that class has a `blocked` worker or one
    at ≥80% context burn (CONTEXT_WARN_PCT) — a quiet foreign fleet renders
    NOTHING above the editor. No new fs reads.
  - **Fitter latent-bug fix**: `layoutFleetRows`' fixed cost ignored the
    double space before the usage column (15 → real 17) and now also carries
    the glyph column (+1 → 18, verified against the rendered row shape);
    floors and shrink priority unchanged. `test/fleet-render-check.ts`
    updated mechanically (rowTotalW helper, L2 expected branch width).
  - New tests: `test/ownership-check.ts` (classifyOwnership case matrix +
    fold-policy cases incl. the fixture-shaped no-line case and an all-mine
    byte-identical golden).
- **Task tree + Tab fold — fleet-UX stage 2 (overlay only)**:
  `/delegate-fleet` rows now group by task + owning session
  (`manifest.dir :: orchestratorSessionPath`, pure `groupWorkerViews`);
  legacy manifests fail open into a per-dir `owner?` bucket that is never
  labeled foreign. Foreign/unknown groups get a one-line dim header
  (`▼ prod-prep · 2/4 live · foreign · ctx↑63%` — ctx is the MAX burn
  across members, dropped when unknown) with `├`/`└` tree glyphs inline in
  the name column (fitter untouched), and fold BY DEFAULT to
  `~ foreign.prod-prep x4 -- L2 v2` (flags: L live, B blocked, ! ctx≥80,
  Q mail, v report; >6 groups collapse into one mega-line). Tab toggles
  fold/unfold (session-scoped memory, folded on first open, no-op when
  nothing is foldable; header hint swaps). Groups sort by their most
  actionable member (mine < owner? < foreign on ties, then slug) and the
  height window is group-atomic — a header never appears without its
  children. MY OWN rows render exactly as stage 1: flat, byte-identical.
  While folded the legend shows the flag key. Per-row ownership glyphs
  stay on every row. Widget untouched. New pure helpers unit-tested in
  `test/fleet-tree-check.ts` (group key, fail-open, two-session split,
  rank ties, flag matrix, fold state machine, pinned goldens at innerW
  58/78/98 folded+expanded, group-atomic window, exact innerW+2 line
  width regression, single-width glyphs).

## [1.11.1] — 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- **Watcher ownership — one orchestrator per wake-up** (two-layer fix, §21.1 F1):
  the watcher mounts into EVERY pi session, but manifests in /tmp/exchange are
  global — so (a) worker sessions received their orchestrator's
  "DELEGATE WATCHER — …" wake-ups and mounted their own redundant watchers, and
  (b) every mounted watcher delivered copies of events from OTHER orchestrators'
  tasks (N sessions = N copies). Now:
  - **Worker gate**: `isWorkerSession(self, manifests)` in `src/watch.ts` — a
    session that is itself a manifest worker (exact worker `sessionPath`, or a
    worktree `checkoutPath` — the `isSelf` strictness, no 24 h lookback) mounts
    NO watcher at `session_start` (`pruneArchive` still runs). Tolerant: garbage
    manifests read as "not a worker", never throw.
  - **Ownership by orchestrator session path**: spawn records
    `orchestratorSessionPath` (the LIVE `sessionManager.getSessionFile()` at
    manifest-write time — never a captured constant: /new and /resume change the
    path, and a new session inheriting no wake-ups is the desired behavior).
    `detectWorkerEvents` emits NOTHING for a worker whose recorded owner differs
    from the watcher's own session (`DetectOptions.selfSessionFile`, threaded
    from `WatcherDeps.self`). Fail-open on both edges: legacy manifests without
    the field and degraded self-ids keep the old behavior — a lost report-ready
    is worse than a duplicate. `collectedAt` logic, report validation, mailbox,
    settle and the `seen` dedup are untouched; the watcher remains a
    manifest-reader (spawn's own record write is unchanged as the only writer).
- **No re-wake on already-collected reports** (field fix): successful collect now
  stamps `collectedAt` (ISO) on the worker's manifest record (best-effort — a
  failure warns, never fails the collect). The watcher treats a `collectedAt`
  worker as delivered and emits no `report-ready`/`report-invalid` for it — the
  watcher's `seen` dedup lives only inside a session, so fresh sessions used to
  re-wake on reports collected in earlier ones (14 stale wake-ups observed in
  the field, v1.11.0 preprod run). Only collect writes the field; other event
  kinds are unaffected.
- **Archive retention**: `pruneArchive(maxAgeMs?)` in `src/archive.ts` deletes
  archived task dirs older than 30 days (folder mtime), best-effort, never
  throws; called once at watcher start (`session_start` in `index.ts`) so the
  archive stops growing without bound.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-09-06

### Added

- **Event-driven background watcher** (`src/watch.ts`, DESIGN.md §21): polls every
  `watch.intervalMs` (default 10 s), aggregates manifests + live herdr statuses +
  worker session JSONL, and wakes the idle orchestrator via
  `pi.sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })` when a worker needs attention.
  Five deduped event kinds: report-ready, report-invalid, mailbox-question,
  grill-deck (toolCall detected in the worker session), context-critical (≥ 90 %),
  worker-dead. Lifecycle mounted on `session_start` / stopped on `session_shutdown`;
  headless-safe; advisory-only (a watcher failure never affects spawn/collect).
- **Backlog section** (DESIGN.md §21.1): fleet scoping of wake-ups (F1),
  report-invalid mtime grace + brief schema (F2), teardown stops worker-dead (F3),
  dedup I/O cost (F5), pre-existing test type errors (P1).

### Changed

- **Spawn settle gate default 120 s → 15 s** (`watch.settleGateMs`, explicit
  `waitMs` still overrides; legacy `timeoutMs` keeps its 120 s cap). After
  detach the orchestrator ends its turn — the watcher wakes it; bash/python
  sleep is an acceptable fallback only when the watcher is unavailable
  (SKILL.md + tool texts updated, DESIGN.md §20.1 annotated).
- **Failed delivery re-fires**: event keys of a dropped batch are rolled back
  from the dedup set, so a transient send error can never permanently swallow
  a wake-up.
- **Dedup state reset**: keys of workers no longer present in any manifest are
  forgotten (code now matches the documented behavior).

### Fixed

- `test/static-check.ts`: `src/watch.ts` added to the canonical dependency-rule
  restricted list.
- `test/transport-contract.ts`: `subDir` hoisted above `try` — the `finally`
  cleanup `rmSync` actually runs now (was leaking temp dirs).

### Tests

- New `test/watcher-check.ts` (95 checks): event detection, dedup/fingerprints,
  reset, delivery rollback, config tolerance, self-mute, lifecycle.
- All pre-existing suites pass unchanged.
